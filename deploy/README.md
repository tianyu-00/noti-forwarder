# Deploy

CI builds the server image and publishes it to GHCR
(`ghcr.io/<owner>/notiforwarder-server`), only when you push to the `publish` branch. Deploying is manual.

## On the Ubuntu server
1. Copy `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` (as `.env`) into a folder.
2. Set `VERSION` in `.env` to an explicit tag (a short commit SHA, or `publish` for the newest build).
3. If the GHCR package is private: `docker login ghcr.io` with a token that has `read:packages`.
4. `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

Roll back by changing `VERSION` and running step 4 again.

CI builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; narrow it once you confirm the host with `uname -m`.
